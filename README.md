Cross-lingual approaches to fine-grained emotion detection
==============

We explore cross-lingual aproaches to fine-grained emotion detection
as well as creating fine-grained emotion datasets for Spanish and Catalan
using Best-Worst Scaling.


Requirements to run the experiments
--------
- python3
- sklearn
- scipy
- transformers


Usage
--------

First, download the pretrained [embeddings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GpyF2h0j8K5TKT7y7Aj0OyPgpFc8pMNS/view), unzip them and place the folder called 'embeddings' in the fine-grained_cross-lingual_emotion directory.

The 'models' folder contains the scripts to reproduce the results in the paper.

Reports Pearson correlation and p-values for models trained on source language data and tested on source (SRC-SRC) and then tested on target language data (SRC-TRG)
